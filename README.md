# NASA Daily Gallery - Portant.co Challenge

App created w vite - React - Typescript - Tailwind Css

## Project Explanation

On the main page of the application, we will find the banner featuring the Astronomical Picture of the Day, sourced from the corresponding API.

Following a brief introduction, we will discover a list of images selected through a drawing among the most well-known planets.

We will be able to mark the images we like the most, also having access to a list of all our favorites.

Lastly, by clicking on any of the images displayed, we will be redirected to a new page with more details about it.

To test the project, it only remains to download and install the npm packages:

```npm install``` && ```npm run dev```

Also here is the .env:

```
